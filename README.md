The One Fact Foundation would like the students at the hackathon to use the data
we have collected to create the https://parrot.reports website to create useful
analytical tools and extensions to study coordinated networks, toxic speech,
conversations, accounts, and misinformation on social networks. You are not
limited to using this dataset and can combine it with external datasets on factchecks, news credibility scores, other news data collections and others available on
dataset aggregators including Google.
----------
Stage 1: Perform network analysis and visualize the kinds of coordinated
communities that exist with respect to what kind of topics and content these
coordinated communities tend to discuss.
What is ‘coordination’? The current Parrot Report site uses counts of any two
accounts, X and Y, sharing the same article URLs, and checks how frequently they
share the same article within a 5, 10, 15, … 60 second window. If the window falls
within 15 seconds, then it checks if these accounts have shared the same article
URL multiple times in the past, within very short periods of time. If accounts X and Y
share an article URL more than 5 different times, within a certain time limit of each
other, we consider it to be ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ because both
accounts may be promoting the same article to get it more visibility on Twitter.
----------
Stage 2: Estimate the Harms from Coordinated Behavior: We would be interested
in any application that can automate analysis of the intentions or agenda of such
coordinated networks. What is possible to understand from the data is the trend of
sharing specific articles relating to some controversial topics. There are specific
behaviors of interest that can be measured, such as accounts promoting some
hashtags, accounts targeting some political personality, or any other entity with a
social media presence, accounts using hate speech and harassment to troll some
other accounts, and so on.
